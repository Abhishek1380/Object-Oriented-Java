# Java OOPs Interview Preparation

This repository is designed to help you quickly revise **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java for interviews. It contains both **theory questions** and **code implementations** of common OOPs principles.

## ðŸ”· Core OOPs Concepts (Theory + Java Specific)

- What are the four pillars of OOP? Explain each.
- What is the difference between class and object?
- What is inheritance in Java? Types of inheritance in Java?
- What is polymorphism? Explain method overloading vs overriding.
- What is encapsulation? How is it implemented in Java?
- What is abstraction? Difference between abstract class and interface?
- Difference between interface and abstract class in Java.
- What is constructor? Types of constructors in Java.
- What is the difference between constructor and method?
- Can constructors be overloaded? Can they be overridden?

---

## ðŸ”· Java-Specific OOPs

- What is `super` and `this` keyword?
- Can a class inherit from multiple classes in Java? Why not?
- What is the use of `final`, `static`, and `private` keywords in OOPs?
- What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?
- What is object slicing and does it happen in Java?
- Can you override a private or static method in Java?
- What is runtime and compile-time polymorphism in Java?
- What is upcasting and downcasting in OOPs?
- What is the diamond problem? How does Java solve it?
- How does Java implement abstraction if it doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance?

---


Each folder contains Java code examples related to the topic for better understanding and hands-on practice.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Ideal for **last-minute revision** before interviews.
- Contains **Java code** and **theory notes**.
- Handy for **freshers**, **intermediate developers**, and **students** preparing for placement or tech interviews.
